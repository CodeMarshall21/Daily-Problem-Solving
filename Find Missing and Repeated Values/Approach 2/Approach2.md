Approach 2: Math
Intuition
At first glance, this problem might seem to require tracking frequencies, but there's a more elegant mathematical approach. In a perfect sequence from 1 to n 
2
 , every number appears exactly once. However, in our given sequence, one number appears twice, and another number is missing. Let’s define the repeated number as x and the missing number as y.

Instead of explicitly counting occurrences, we can leverage basic mathematical properties of numbers. The sum of all numbers in a proper sequence from 1 to n 
2
  can be computed using the formula:

perfectSum= 
2
n 
2
 ⋅(n 
2
 +1)
​
 
​
 
Similarly, the sum of the squares of these numbers follows this formula:

perfectSqrSum= 
6
n 
2
 ⋅(n 
2
 +1)⋅(2n 
2
 +1)
​
 
​
 
Now, if we compute the sum of numbers in our given grid (sum) and compare it with perfectSum, we can express their relationship as:

sum=perfectSum+x−y
​
 
This tells us that the difference between the actual sum and the perfect sum gives us:

sumDiff=x−y
​
 
Similarly, if we compute the sum of squares from our grid (sqrSum) and compare it with perfectSqrSum, we get:

sqrDiff=x 
2
 −y 
2
 
​
 
Now, we recall a fundamental algebraic identity:

x 
2
 −y 
2
 =(x+y)⋅(x−y)
​
 
Since we already know x−y from sumDiff, we can substitute it into the equation:

sqrDiff=(x+y)⋅sumDiff
​
 
Rearranging this equation, we can solve for x+y:

x+y= 
sumDiff
sqrDiff
​
 
​
 
Now, we have two simple equations:

x−y=sumDiff
​
 
x+y= 
sumDiff
sqrDiff
​
 
​
 
Solving for x and y:

x= 
2
sqrDiff/sumDiff+sumDiff
​
 
​
 
y= 
2
sqrDiff/sumDiff−sumDiff
​
 
​
 
This mathematical derivation translates directly into our code. We first calculate the actual sums from our grid and then compute the perfect sums using the formulas. The differences between these give us sumDiff and squareDifference, which we can plug into our final formulas to get the repeating and missing numbers.

Note: One important implementation detail is the use of long instead of int for our calculations. This is crucial because when we're dealing with squares of numbers, we can easily exceed the integer range.

Algorithm
Initialize variables:
sum and sqrSum to 0 to store the actual sums from the grid.
n to store the length of the grid.
Initialize a variable total to n * n to store the total number of elements.
For each row in the grid:
For each col in the grid:
Add the current element to sum.
Add the square of the current element to sqrSum.
Calculate the sumDiff by subtracting the expected sum (total * (total + 1) / 2) from the actual sum.
Calculate the sqrDiff by subtracting the expected square sum (total * (total + 1) * (2 * total + 1) / 6) from the actual sqrSum.
Calculate repeat using the formula (sqrDiff / sumDiff + sumDiff) / 2.
Calculate missing using the formula (sqrDiff / sumDiff - sumDiff) / 2.
Return an array containing repeat and missing numbers.
