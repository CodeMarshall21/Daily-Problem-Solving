# Explanation: Count and Say - Python Solution

## Approach
The given solution solves the **Count and Say** problem using an **iterative** approach. Instead of recursion, it generates the sequence one step at a time from 1 up to `n`.

## Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 1. Helper Function: `counts(num)`
This function takes a numeric string as input and returns its **run-length encoding**. Here's how it works:

#### Input:
A string `num` representing the previous term in the sequence.

#### Process:
- Traverse the string.
- Count how many times the same digit repeats consecutively.
- When the digit changes (or the end of the string is reached), append the count and the digit to a list.

#### Example:
Input: `"3322251"`
- "33" → "23"
- "222" → "32"
- "5" → "15"
- "1" → "11"

Output: `"23321511"`

#### Code:
```python
arr.append(str(count) + num[i - 1])
```

### 2. Initialization:
```python
num = "1"
```
This sets the starting point of the sequence as per the problem definition: `countAndSay(1) = "1"`.

### 3. Iterative Sequence Generation:
```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    num = counts(num)
```
This loop runs `n - 1` times and updates `num` to the next term in the sequence each time.

### 4. Return the nth Term:
After completing the iterations, the final string `num` is returned.

## Final Notes
- **Time Complexity:** O(n * m), where `n` is the number of iterations and `m` is the average length of the string in each iteration.
- **Space Complexity:** O(m) for the temporary list used in the helper function.
- **Scalability:** Works efficiently for `n` up to 30, as required by the problem.

## Example Walkthrough
For `n = 4`, the steps are:
1. `1`
2. "one 1" → `11`
3. "two 1s" → `21`
4. "one 2, one 1" → `1211`

**Final Output:** `"1211"`

## Why This Works
This solution aligns perfectly with the definition of the Count and Say problem and is implemented efficiently using a helper function and loop. No recursion needed.
